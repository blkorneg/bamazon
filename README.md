# bamazon


Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.
Then created a table inside database called products.
Populated database with 10 different products. 
Created a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. It will display all of  items available for sale. Included ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
The app should then prompt users with two messages.
The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
If not, the app will log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.
However, if store have enough of product, cusotmer order will be fulfill. 
This means updating  SQL database to reflect remaining quantity.
Once updated customer will be shown total cost of their purchase.
